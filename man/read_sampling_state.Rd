\title{Read in a Gibbs sampling state}
\usage{
read_sampling_state(filename, data_type = "integer", big_workdir = tempdir())
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{the name of a CSV file holding the simplified state: a CSV
with header row and four columns, \code{document,word,topic,count}, where
the documents, words, and topics are \emph{zero-index}. Create the file
from MALLET output using \code{\link{simplify_state}}.}

\item{data_type}{the C++ type to store the data in. If all values have
magnitude less than \eqn{2^15}, you can get away with \code{"short"}, but
guess what? Linguistic data hates you, and a typical vocabulary can easily
include more word types than that, so the default is \code{"integer"}.}

\item{big_workdir}{the working directory where
\code{\link[bigmemory]{read.big.matrix}} will store its temporary files. By
default, uses \code{\link[base]{tempdir}}, but if you have more scratch
space elsewhere, use that for handling large sampling states.}
}
\value{
a \code{big.matrix} with four columns,
  \code{document,word,topic,count}. Documents, words, and topics are
  \emph{one-indexed} in the result, so these values may be used as indices to
  the vectors returned by \code{\link{doc_ids}}, \code{\link{vocabulary}},
  \code{\link{doc_topics}}, etc.
}
\description{
This function reads in a Gibbs sampling state represented by
\code{document,word,topic,count} rows to a
\code{\link[bigmemory]{big.matrix}}. This gives the model's assignments of
words to topics within documents. MALLET itself remembers token order, but
in ordinary LDA the words are assumed exchangeable within documents. The
recommended interface to this sampling state is
\code{\link{load_sampling_state}}, which calls this function.
}
\details{
\emph{N.B.} The MALLET sampling state, and the "simplified state" output by
this function to disk, index documents, words, and topics from zero, but the
dataframe returned by this function indexes these from one, for convenience
within R.
