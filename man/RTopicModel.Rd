\details{
For its R interface, MALLET uses a class RTopicModel. This has some
convenience methods for accessing and manipulating a topic model from
R using rJava. It is also used by the functions in the \pkg{mallet}
package.

In earlier versions of MALLET, this object had a data member of class
ParallelTopicModel instance. In the latest MALLET, RTopicModel inherits from
ParallelTopicModel.
