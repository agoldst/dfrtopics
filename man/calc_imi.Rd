\title{IMI calculation routine}
\usage{
calc_imi(doc_topics_k, term_doc_k)
}
\arguments{
\item{doc_topics_k}{vector of \emph{counts}, one for each document, of words
assigned to topic \eqn{k}}

\item{term_doc_k}{matrix of counts, where element \eqn{i,j} is the number of
words of type \eqn{i} in document (or document-group) \eqn{j} is assigned
to topic \eqn{k}}
}
\value{
a vector of scores, one for each row of \code{term_doc_k}
}
\description{
The actual computation of IMI (instantaneous mutual information) values for
\code{\link{imi_topic}} is done by this routine. If you are calling
\code{imi_topic} repeatedly for a given topic, you can gain some speed by
pre-calculating the inputs and supplying them directly to this function.
