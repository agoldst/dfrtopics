\usage{
topic_divergences(m, n_words = 1000)

doc_topic_cor(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{\code{mallet_model} model object}

\item{n_words}{Number of columns of the topic-word matrix to use
in calculation. The words with the top \code{n_words} \emph{total}
weight in the corpus are used. Set to \code{Inf} or to
\code{ncol(topic_words(m))} to use all the words, but be warned
that R rapidly approaches its limits with large vocabularies.
Ordinarily, for a vocabulary of tens of thousands of features,
\code{n_words=1000} will be a fine approximation.}
}
\value{
For \code{doc_topic_cor}, a matrix of correlations between the series
  of log-document proportions; for \code{topic_divergences}, a matrix of J-S
  divergences between topic distributions over words.
}
\description{
Two methods for extracting a matrix of topic-topic distances.
