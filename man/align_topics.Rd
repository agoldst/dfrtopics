\title{Align topics across models}
\usage{
align_topics(dst, threshold)

print.topic_alignment(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{dst}{result from \code{\link{model_distances}} (q.v.)}

\item{threshold}{maximum dissimilarity allowed between merging clusters. By
default, the threshold is set so that any two topics from different models
may ultimately join a cluster. More aggressive thresholding is
recommended, in order to expose isolated topics.}
}
\value{
a \code{topic_alignment} object, which is a list of:
\describe{
  \item{\code{clusters}}{list of vectors, one for each model, giving cluster
    numbers of the topics in the model}
  \item{\code{distances}}{list of vectors, one for each model, giving the
    distance at which the given topic merged into its cluster. Because
    single-link clustering (if I've even implemented it correctly) is
    subject to "chaining," this is not necessarily an indication of the
    quality of a cluster, but it may give some hints.}
  \item{\code{model_distances}}{The supplied \code{model_distances}}
  \item{\code{threshold}}{The threshold used}
}
To explore the result, \code{\link{alignment_frame}} may be useful.
}
\description{
Given information about the dissimilarities among topics across
a set of models, this function attempts to identify groups of
similar topics from each model. In particular, it greedily seeks
the single-link clustering in which no two topics from the same
model are found in the same cluster ("up-to-one mapping"). The idea
is from (Chuang et al., 2015). The implementation is my own (slow,
unverified, \emph{experimental}) one. To prepare topic dissimilarities to
supply to this function, use \code{\link{model_distances}}.
