\title{Remove infrequent words}
\usage{
wordcounts_remove_rare(counts, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{The dataframe from \code{\link{read_wordcounts}}}

\item{n}{The maximum rank to keep: all words with frequency rank below
\code{n} will be discarded}
}
\value{
A filtered word-counts dataframe. Because of ties, do not expect
  it to have exactly \code{n} distinct words.
}
\description{
Filter out the words in a wordcounts dataframe whose overall frequency is
below a threshold.
}
\details{
It's often useful to prune documents of one-off words (many of which are
OCR errors) before building MALLET instances. This is a convenience function
for doing so.
