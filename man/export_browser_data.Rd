\usage{
export_browser_data(m, out_dir, zipped = TRUE, n_top_words = 50,
  n_scaled_words = 1000, supporting_files = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE,
  internalize = FALSE, info = NULL, proper = FALSE,
  digits = getOption("digits"), permute = NULL, data_dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{\code{mallet_model} object from \code{\link{train_model}} or
\code{\link{load_mallet_model}}}

\item{out_dir}{directory for output. If \code{supporting_files} is TRUE, the
exported data files will go in a \code{"data"} directory under
\code{out_dir}.}

\item{zipped}{should the larger data files be zipped? (If TRUE, uses
\code{\link[utils]{zip}}, which requires the \code{zip} utility be
available.)}

\item{n_top_words}{how many top words per topic to save?}

\item{n_scaled_words}{how many word types to use in scaled coordinates
calculation?}

\item{supporting_files}{if TRUE (FALSE is default), all the files
needed to run the browser are copied to \code{out_dir}, with the
exported data placed appropriately. From a shell in \code{out_dir},
run \code{bin/server} to launch a local web server.}

\item{overwrite}{if TRUE, this will clobber existing files}

\item{internalize}{if TRUE, write data directly into the browser's
\code{index.html} source instead of into a series of separate files.}

\item{info}{a list of dfr-browser parameters. Converted to JSON with
\code{\link[jsonlite]{toJSON}} and stored in \code{info.json}. If omitted,
default values (\code{getOption("dfrtopics.browser_info")}) are used. No
file is written if \code{info=FALSE}.}

\item{proper}{if TRUE, the document-topic and topic-word matrices will be
smoothed by the hyperparameters alpha and beta (respectively) and normalized
before export, instead of the "raw" sampling weights (which is the default).
For MALLET models, moothed and normalized weights then give the maximum a
posteriori estimates of the corresponding probabilities, which is "properly"
what the modeling process yields (but may disguise the effects of variations
in document length---and increase the storage space required).}

\item{digits}{if \code{proper} is TRUE, probabilities are rounded to this
decimal place, yielding a somewhat sparser doc-topics matrix (the topic-word
matrix is more aggressively truncated anyway). Set to NULL for no rounding.
Rounded weights are renormalized within dfr-browser itself.}

\item{permute}{if non-NULL, specifies a renumbering of the topics: the new
topic \code{k} is old topic \code{permute[k]}. (If you have the inverse, use
\code{\link{order}(permute)} to invert it back.)}

\description{
Transform and save modeling results in a format suitable for use by
\href{http://agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser}{dfr-browser}, the web-browser
based model browser. For a quick export and immediate viewing, see also
\code{\link{dfr_browser}}.
}
\details{
This routine reports on its progress. By default, it saves zipped versions of
the document-topics matrix and metadata files; dfr-browser supports
client-side unzipping. This function compresses files using R's
\code{\link{zip}} command. If that fails, set \code{zipped=F} (and, if you
wish, zip the files using another program).

A detailed description of the output files can be found in the dfr-browser
technical notes at \url{http://github.com/agoldst/dfr-browser}.

This package includes a copy of the dfr-browser files necessary to run the
browser. By default, this routine only exports data files. To also copy
over the dfr-browser source (javascript, HTML, and CSS), pass
\code{supporting_files=T}. To insert the data directly into the main
\code{index.html} file, also passed \code{internalize=T}. I recommend this
last option for local viewing only, not for web hosting; in the latter case,
separate data files will allow for asynchronous loading.

\section{Metadata format}{


If you are working with non-JSTOR documents, the one file that will reflect
this is the exported metadata. dfr-browser expects seven metadata columns:
\code{id,title,author,journaltitle,volume,issue,pubdate,pagerange}. This
function looks for these seven columns and, if it finds them, writes the
metadata with these columns in this order. Any remaining columns are pushed
all the way to the right of the output. (dfr-browser ignores them unless you
customize it.) If any these columns is not present in \code{metadata(m)},
then \code{export_browser_data} will simply save all the metadata as is,
adjusting only the CSV format to match the baseline expectation of
dfr-browser (namely, a headerless CSV conforming to
\href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180}{RFC 4180}.). If your metadata does
not match these expectations, you may have to write out the metadata yourself
and/or customize dfr-browser to get satisfactory results.

Note that you can adjust the metadata held on the model object by assigning
to \code{metadata(m)} before exporting the browser data. In particular, if
you have many documents, you may wish to conserve space by eliminating
metadata columns that are not used by the visualization: for example,
\code{metadata(m)$publisher <- NULL}. Earlier versions of dfrtopics tried to
eliminate such columns automatically, but this more conservative approach
aims to allow you more flexibility about what gets exported.

\dontrun{
m <- model_dfr_documents("citations.CSV", "wordcounts",
    "stoplist.txt", n_topics=40)

# export all files needed for browser program
export_browser_data(m, out_dir="browser", supporting_files=T)

# or: overwrite model data only for an already-existing browser
export_browser_data(m, out_dir="browser/data",
    supporting_files=F, overwrite=T)
